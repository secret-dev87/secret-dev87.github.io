Hello! I'm Bruce, from Canada.

I am a creative, time punctual, dedicated, goal-oriented individual with decent moral Values and Ethicates along with a high-energy level, honed communication skills, strong organizational skills, and meticulous attention to detail.

I am currently a full stack software developer, focused mainly on C# and Typescript/Javascript using different frameworks such as ASP.NET, React, Next.js and AWS Lambda/NodeJS.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
